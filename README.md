# MERN Social Network API üöÄ

## Description
This project is a **backend API** for a social network application. It uses:
- **MongoDB** as the database (NoSQL)
- **Mongoose** as the ODM (Object Data Modeling)
- **Express.js** for handling routes
- **TypeScript** for type safety and improved development experience

This API allows users to:
- Create a user
- Update user information
- Delete a user (and their associated thoughts)
- Add and remove friends from their friend list
- Create thoughts (like posts)
- Update and delete thoughts
- Add and remove reactions to thoughts (like comments)
